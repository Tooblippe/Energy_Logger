{"name":"Energy logger","tagline":"This is my attempt to build a small home based energy logger. It is not unique but has an RF12 on board so it can integrate with other systems, and it logs data to a OpenLog unit. This makes changing SD cards and logging a breeze It is based on OpenEnergyMonitor Many of these projects have been done all around the world. I think what makes this one unique is the fact that the sensor unit (the arduino with the CT) has a RF12 radio built in and also an Openlog unit from Sparkfun. The OpenLog unit is connected to the UART of the sensor unit. Full control off the Openlog can be obtained via the remote unit connected via RF12 radio.This means that the sensor unit can keep on logging to the Openlog. You can remotely initiate a session with the Openlog from the base station, and make changes to the settings, before putting it back in logging mode.","body":"/*\r\n  Arduino based RF12 enabled energy logger\r\n  Created by Tobie Nortje, tobie.nortje@navitas.co.za\r\n  http://navitas.co.za/tobienortje/\r\n  https://github.com/Tooblippe/Energy_Logger/wiki\r\n  GNU GPL\r\n*/\r\n\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\r\nProject components\r\n1 or 2 arduinos with or without an RF 12 radio\r\n1 x OpenLog unit connected to UART of sensor - for logging data - https://github.com/nseidle/OpenLog/wiki\r\n1 x 100 AMP CT\r\n1st arduino with CT logs energy and send via RF12 radio and serial\r\n2nd arduino receives RF12 signal and send value via serial port\r\nThis software can read eiter, or both if ran on seperate computers or ports\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\r\nFunction\r\nListens to serial port at port number = port at baud = baud\r\nArduino only sents one value every couple of seconds.\r\nThis code should be able to read the sensor board and the client board.\r\nDo with the code what you want. \\n\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\r\nFile format : logs to csv in DATE, TIME, POWER\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\r\nArduino UNO - connected current probe and RF12 Radio\r\nCurrent probe - 100A, SCT-013-00, order from NETRAM - http://www.netram.co.za/Sensors/Non-invasive-AC-current-sensor-100A.html\r\nCurrent probe - http://www.seeedstudio.com/depot/noninvasive-ac-current-sensor-100a-max-p-547.html\r\nCurrent probe - bias resistors 2x10kOhm and 10uF Capacitor.
